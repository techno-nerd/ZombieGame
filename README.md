# Shoot Some Zombies!

This is a simple game in Java, where you need to move around and shoot the incoming zombies.
As you shoot, you're gun get's progressively better:

Pistol (0) -> Shotgun (10) -> AK-47 (20) -> Machine Gun (50)

The main difference is the fire rate (milliseconds between shots). These constants are defined in `ZombieSurvivalGame.java`

## Controls

- Left arrow: Move left
- Right arrow: Move right
- Space: Shoot
- E: Switch hands

Zombies are going to move towards you, hence you will need to switch hands to shoot them

# Good luck, and protect your brain!
