# Shoot Some Zombies!

This is a simple game in Java, where you need to move around and shoot the incoming zombies.
As you shoot, you're gun gets progressively better (and you get slower because the gun is heavier):

Pistol (0) -> Shotgun (10) -> AK-47 (20) -> Machine Gun (50)

The main difference is the fire rate (milliseconds between shots). These constants are defined in `ZombieSurvivalGame.java`

## Controls

- Left arrow: Move left
- Right arrow: Move right
- Space: Shoot
- E: Switch hands
- Q: Special move - Eradicate all zombies (does not give you points!). You can only use this 3 times!

Zombies are going to move towards you, hence you will need to switch hands to shoot them

## Tips and Tricks

- You can hold down the Arrow keys but not the Space bar (get quick fingers and keep clicking Space!)
- Don't get cornered
- Save your special move for when you get slower (or don't?)
